# Multimodal AD Data Enhanced Framework
CDSS for AD


### Project Overview
This project is created based on the enhanced framework for multimodal AD data. It currently includes the main algorithm modules related to the paper, along with two desensitized datasets provided in this repository. To reproduce the results of the paper, adjusting certain network structure parameters according to the specific dataset is all that's needed.

### Project Structure

* **Algorithm Modules**: This repository contains the implementation code for the main algorithm modules used in the paper.
* **Datasets**: Two desensitized datasets are included in this repository, named adni1_train.pkl (adni1_test.pkl) and adni2_train.pkl (adni2_test.pkl).

### Reproducing Paper Results

If you wish to reproduce the results of the paper, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local environment:
```angular2html
https://github.com/Chriszhangmw/Multimodal-AD-Fusion
```

* Navigate to the appropriate folder based on the dataset you are using:
```angular2html
cd Multimodal-AD-Fusion
```
* Adjust network structure parameters: Depending on your dataset, you may need to modify the code's network structure parameters to fit your data.

* Run the code: Follow the code execution instructions provided in the paper for training and testing processes.

### Feature Aware Results
In the code, you can find two variables, all_index_bad1 and all_index_bad2, corresponding to the feature-aware results. Analyzing these variables provides information about feature-awareness.
